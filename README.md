# Neo Template Library
My take on a modern template library for C++. 

## Description
This repository contains my custom template library for modern C++.
This project was started as part of my effort to develop a Game Engine.
I thought about open sourcing the containers, as time went on and the containers implemented in the game engine matured.
This library is still very much subject to change but might provide use to some developers.

## Notes
I chose to use Ninja instead of Make due to improved build performance.
Anything in this repository is highly experimental and I expect stuff to not work sometimes.
This repository will probably receive more updates in the next few months.
I won't and can't guarantee that anything works (correctly) and/or that nothing will break.
